# Overview: Food Spoilage and Harvest Loss
The Rockefeller Foundation estimates 470 million smallholder farmers and supply chain actors across developing countries lose an average of 15 per cent of their income to food spoilage. It is estimated a solution for food spoilage would feed one billion more people by 2050. The main issues farmers in developing countries across the world face is food storage and detection of spoiled foods. This comes at a cost to both farmers and processing companies. Food waste (FLW) across the agriculture sector is an increasingly growing contributor to greenhouse emissions, with an estimated 50% of post-harvest crops wasted in Kenya (Global, 2015) . This has unparalleled effects on the environment with each wasted product not only incurring the loss of edible food but contributing to methane production, which United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated to be 25 times more efficient at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Food waste occurs due to pests and storage conditions, with many farmers, pack houses and exporters throwing away yield due to appearance and fears of spoilage. Current methods of determining spoilage remain qualitative, but the detection of released gases and computer vision provides a more effective solution. A low-cost solution is required which not only improves food preservation but can also detect food spoilage to assure food quality.
